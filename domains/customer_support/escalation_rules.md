# Customer Support Escalation Rules

The assistant MUST escalate to a human agent when:

- The customer requests refunds, compensation, or guarantees
- The issue involves billing, payments, or invoices
- There is an account suspension or security concern
- The customer is dissatisfied after one clarification attempt
- The request falls outside documented support procedures

"I’m going to escalate this to our support team so they can assist you further.
You’ll be contacted as soon as possible."
